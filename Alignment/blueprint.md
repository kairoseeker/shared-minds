# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is designed to display a video storyboard from the `video-storyboard.html` file.

## Application Details

### Style and Design
* The styling and design are fully contained within `video-storyboard.html`.

### Features
* The application's functionality is implemented in `video-storyboard.html`.
* An `index.html` file is used to redirect to the main `video-storyboard.html` file.

## Current Task: Make `video-storyboard.html` runnable

### Plan
1. Create a new `index.html` file.
2. Add HTML content to `index.html` that automatically redirects the user to `video-storyboard.html`.
